MARKDOWN HELP

Viewport height understanding was the biggest challenge. I overcame that by researching what viewport was and why it is important. The other challenge I had was thinking the HTML had to be more complicated than it had to be. I overcame this with advice from a friend who said "it only need to be as complicated as it needs to be to work correctly".
